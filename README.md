# Portfolio Website - Back-end

## 📌 Overview

This project is a server in Node.js/Express for my personal portfolio website.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment 
- **Express** – Framework for Node.js
- **nodemailer** - Node.js module for sending email
- **express-rate-limit** - Limits the number of admissible emails per minute
- **validator** - Sanitize the contact form fields
